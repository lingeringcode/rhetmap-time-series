A repo for a dataviz of Jim Ridolfo's [rhetmap.org](http://rhetmap.org/) data.

- Spreadsheet of data: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GuECV6Ot60h-Qab3e9-KPaKLdgXB3reoyZgo3VTlO_w/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GuECV6Ot60h-Qab3e9-KPaKLdgXB3reoyZgo3VTlO_w/edit#gid=0)
- Data Feed Source: [https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1GuECV6Ot60h-Qab3e9-KPaKLdgXB3reoyZgo3VTlO_w/od6/public/values?alt=json](https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1GuECV6Ot60h-Qab3e9-KPaKLdgXB3reoyZgo3VTlO_w/od6/public/values?alt=json)
- Idea for Multi-Series Line Chart: [https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884955](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884955), which I originall located on the D3 Gallery page under the "[Basic Charts](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/gallery#basic-charts)" heading.
